    <h1>About the PI: Sergi Valverde</h1>
    <h3>(also known as Sergio Valverde)</h3>
    <p>
        Dr. Sergi Valverde is a complex systems scientist and head of the Evolution of Networks group at the <a href="https://www.ibe.upf-csic.es/valverde">Institute of Evolutionary Biology (CSIC)</a>.

Gould, which posits that evolution proceeds in rapid bursts separated by periods of stasis (see below); and <a href="https://apps.tamusa.edu/course-information/my-profile/faculty-Profile.php?ID=461">Prof. Michael J. O’Brien</a>, a leading figure in evolutionary archaeology and biology with extensive publications across major journals like <em>Science</em> and <em>Nature Communications</em>.

    <p>
        Sergi is also a board member of <a href="http://complexitat.cat/people">Complexitat.cat</a>, the Catalan Network for the Study of Complex Systems. His research interests include complex networks, collective intelligence, and computational models of evolutionary and ecological processes. Currently, he is working on an evolutionary theory of technological innovation.

    <h1>Research Interests</h1>

    <h3>Punctuated Evolution</h3>
    <p>
        Our research explores the dynamics of punctuated evolution, expanding the theory beyond paleontology and evolutionary biology. In recent work, such as "On the multiscale dynamics of punctuated evolution" <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(24)00114-9">(Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 2024)</a>, we integrate computational models and field observations from molecular biology, anthropology, and sociotechnology, providing a framework applicable to both ancient extinctions and potential future disruptions. Further, "The many ways toward punctuated evolution" <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pala.12731">(Palaeontology, 2024)</a> emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between punctuated equilibria in the fossil record and the broader concept of punctuated evolution. This phenomenon, influenced by eco-evolutionary feedbacks and external disruptions, occurs across various biological and artificial systems. In "Punctuated equilibrium at 50: Anything there for evolutionary anthropology? Yes; definitely" <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/evan.22009">(Evolutionary Anthropology, 2023)</a>, we revisit the foundational aspects of the theory to propose a model relevant to biocultural evolution, helping us interpret sudden shifts in human cultural and biological diversity amidst increasing ecological pressures.
    </p>
    <p>
        Together, these studies underscore punctuated evolution as a unifying concept with broad applications, enhancing our understanding of life’s history and offering a framework for anticipating future evolutionary challenges.
    </p>

    <h3>Evolution of Technology</h3>

    <p>
        Our research investigates the origins of innovation in cultural and technological evolution, focusing on the role of information networks and their interaction with ecosystems. As a critical yet often invisible technology, software requires quantitative theories of evolution and development. We have pioneered models that treat software systems as complex networks, exploring how principles from information theory can enrich biology and evolutionary studies.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Technological evolution distinguishes human culture, enabling unique capabilities beyond those of other species. However, a comprehensive quantitative theory of technological change is still emerging. Key questions drive our research: How do optimality principles, constraints, and historical contingencies shape network organization? Are selective pressures akin to those in natural evolution applicable to technology? To what degree do recombination and adaptation fuel innovation? Our recent projects, including the Spanish National Grant FIS2016-77447-R, explore these questions.

        Check out my YouTube talk <a href="https://youtu.be/6KWByQPcAXo?si=K1Uy5PXLyNMAMhsf" target="_blank">"The Ascent of the Computer"</a> at the European Center for Living Technology (Venice, Italy), where I am a research fellow.  In this talk, I reviewed the major transitions in information technologies, with a focus on their connections to biological evolutionary frameworks. We examine the symbiotic evolution of software and hardware, which shows strong social dependencies and extrinsic fitness constraints due to energy and time limitations. Properly accounting for these material and social factors helps explain the coexistence of gradualism and punctuated dynamics in technological evolution.

    <h3>Dynamics and Evolution of Ecological Networks</h3>
    <p>
        In response to accelerating ecological change, our work investigates how environmental heterogeneity influences species adaptation. Beyond empirical data, we aim to build mathematical theories to predict ecosystem responses to disturbances. Our focus includes spatial dynamics and distributed growth within ecological networks, with particular attention to bipartite networks like host-phage interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Traditional network models can overlook critical environmental factors and anthropogenic effects on ecosystem features such as modularity and nestedness. Habitat-mediated interactions suggest a need to extend networks to hypergraphs. In a recent study (Valverde et al., 2020), we applied hypergraph modeling to real-world plant-virus interactions, uncovering the adaptive flexibility of ecosystems facing environmental change (see the short talk below).

    <h3>Evolution of Artificial Life</h3>
    <p>
        Artificial life aims to understand life by creating systems with life-like properties. We explore whether artificial systems can demonstrate creativity and innovation through platforms like Avida and our own Chimera model. Our ongoing research plans include scaling these computational models to simulate large-scale ecosystem evolution.
