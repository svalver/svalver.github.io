    <h1>About the PI: Sergi Valverde</h1>
    <h3>(also known as Sergio Valverde)</h3>
    <p>
        Dr. Sergi Valverde is a complex systems scientist and head of the Evolution of Networks group at the <a href="https://www.ibe.upf-csic.es/valverde">Institute of Evolutionary Biology (CSIC)</a>. Born in Barcelona, he studied computer science and physics at the School of Informatics (FIB) of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) and spent five years as a professional game developer (1997-2002). Sergi's scientific career was guided by ICREA Professor Ricard Solé (Complex Systems Lab, 2003-2016) and was enriched by his many visits to the <a href="https://www.santafe.edu">Santa Fe Institute</a>. From 2009 to 2020, he served as an assistant professor of "Complexity Science" and "Evolutionary Algorithms" at the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Universitat Pompeu Fabra.
    </p>
    <p>
        He collaborates actively with the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nonlineardynamicsevolutionlab">Node Lab</a> at the Centre for Mathematical Research (Dr. Josep Sardanyés), the <a href="https://anthropology.utk.edu/people/alex-bentley/">University of Tennessee at Knoxville</a> (Prof. R. Alex Bentley), the Universitat Politècnica de València (Prof. Santiago F. Elena, Evolutionary Systems Virology Group), and the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Prof. Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo). Additionally, he is a board member of <a href="http://complexitat.cat/people">Complexitat.cat</a>, the Catalan Network for the Study of Complex Systems. His published research explores complex networks, collective intelligence, and computational models of evolutionary and ecological processes. Currently, Sergi is developing an evolutionary theory of technological innovation.

    <h1>Research Interests</h1>

    <h2>Evolution of Technology</h2>
    <p>
        Our research aims to uncover the origins of innovation in cultural and technological evolution, focusing on information networks and their interaction with natural ecosystems. Software, as an invisible yet crucial technology, requires quantitative and testable theories of evolution and development. We have pioneered modeling software systems as complex networks and believe there are profound lessons to be drawn from this information-theoretical approach to biology and evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Technological evolution is a distinctive feature of human culture, enabling us to expand our capabilities far beyond other species. However, we still lack a comprehensive quantitative theory of technological change, particularly when compared to biological evolution. Key questions drive our research: How do optimality principles, constraints, and historical contingencies shape network organization? Do selective pressures similar to those in natural evolution apply to technology? To what extent is innovation the result of recombination and adaptation? Our recent projects (e.g., Spanish National Grant FIS2016-77447-R) exemplify these investigations.

    <h3>Dynamics and Evolution of Ecological Networks</h3>
    <p>
        In the face of rapidly changing and degrading ecosystems, understanding how environmental heterogeneity influences species adaptation is increasingly critical. Beyond empirical data, we need mathematical theories to explain how ecosystems respond to external disturbances. We examine how spatial embedding affects distributed growth and dynamics within networks. Although pairwise species interactions have been studied extensively, our group leverages complex networks and systems theory to develop evolutionary models of ecological networks, including host-phage bipartite networks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Network models, while useful, may overlook key environmental dependencies and anthropogenic effects on ecosystem features like modularity and nestedness. Habitat-mediated interactions suggest extending networks to hypergraphs. In a recent study (Valverde et al., 2020), we applied hypergraph modeling to real-world plant-virus interactions, revealing the adaptive flexibility of ecosystems in response to environmental shifts (see the short talk below).

    <h3>Evolution of Artificial Life</h3>
    <p>
        Artificial life seeks to understand life by creating systems that exhibit life-like properties. For example, can artificial systems demonstrate creativity and innovation? We explore these questions through systems like Avida and our own physically based artificial life platforms, such as Chimera (see video below or <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0059664">read the paper here</a>). We plan to extend this computational approach to model the evolution of large-scale ecosystems in future studies.
