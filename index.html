<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>My group develops theoretical methods and applies computational models towards understanding the origin of complexity in natural and artificial systems. In the short term, models are used for the successful development of technological systems. In the long term, the integration of engineering and knowledge will enable us to understand the design principles and dynamics of living systems and apply these principles to engineer new cellular behaviour.</p>

<p>My research field, complex systems, plays an important role in the emerging fields of systems and synthetic biology. I am interested in using complex networks to solve problems in biomedical sciences.  Although we focus in specific systems (<a href="/about">read more </a>), network theory and associated methods have wider applicability. Complex networks allow for (1) analysis of experimental results, (2) comparison between real and simulated systems, (3) quantifying the degree of uncertainty in models and (4) improving data collection methods.</p>

<p>I am Visiting Professor at the Complex Systems Lab (Universitat Pompeu Fabra).</p>
