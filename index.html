<h2>Welcome</h2>

 <p> Evolution of Networks belongs to the Institute for Evolutionary Biology (IBE). This group is led by CSIC Tenured Scientist Sergi Valverde, and studies natural and artificial networks in the search of universal evolutionary principles. We are interested in the role played by emergence, convergence and environmental fluctuations in the origin of evolutionary innovations, and how the pattern and process of evolution differs when traits are learned rather than transmitted genetically. Cultural evolution depend on social learning, which provides a non-genetic pathway for the transmission of adaptive traits. The group brings expertise in complex systems, complex networks, and theoretical ecology.</p>
        
<p>We study different approaches to extend evolutionary theory beyond the  domain of biology. This effort depends on empirical analysis and theoretical modelling. An unique approach of our lab is the complex networks perspective of the evolution of culture, which we have developed over the years (see our review paper <a href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1701/20150450">here</a>). We also develop systematic ways to recollect and analyse the rich fossil record of inventions. </p>

    <td><h3>Sergi Valverde (Principal Investigator)</h3>
        <p>With a background in computer science and physics, I work as a Network Scientist at 
            the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (IBE). I am fascinated by evolutionary theory 
            and its applications outside biology (and related fields like Cultural Evolution). 
            One of my scientific obsessions is the coevolution of hardware and software, which 
            I believe is a quintessential example of complexity evolution in both natural 
            and artificial systems. My primary research interests are Complex Networks, 
            Theoretical Ecology, and Cultural Evolution.</p>

    <td><h3>Salva Duran-Nebreda (Postdoctoral Researcher)</h3>
    <p>I am a Biotechnologist and Complex Systems researcher interested in the Major Transitions in Evolution. 
        In particular, I am fascinated by how individuality shifts as new levels of selection are created 
        and how emergent properties appear in collective systems, from multicellular entities to ecosystems 
        and societies.  My research includes aspects of Synthetic Biology, EvoDevo, Pattern Formation, 
        Complex Networks in Ecology and Cultural Evolution.</p>

    <td> <h3>Blai Vidiella (Postdoctoral Researcher)</h3>
    <p>Together with Sergi Valverde and <a href="https://www.crm.cat/person/37/sardanyes-cayuela-josep/">Josep Sardanyes (CRM)</a>, I am a postdoctoral researcher on 
        the "MPA4sustainability" Biodiversa project. To prevent ecological collapse, I am designing, 
        simulating, and evaluating engineered systems. Thus, I draw on concepts from a wide range 
        of disciplines, including ecology (for determining what's needed), computer science 
        (for the abstract design of necessary circuits), synthetic biology (for creature engineering), 
        dynamical systems (such as ghost phenomena and chaos), and mathematical modeling 
        (to test and predicting behaviour). My studies have helped us get a deeper comprehension of 
        the interplay between human activities and the biotic components of ecosystems that are 
        under danger, as well as how to keep these ecosystems healthy via biological means. 
        Will it be possible for us to Terraform our planet?
