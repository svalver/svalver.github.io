My research plan is complemented with my current teaching activities in the Degree 
of Biomedical Engineering (22106, 22107, 22117, 22123) and the Degree in Human 
Biology (20332), which focuses in computer simulation (Netlogo and Matlab/Octave), 
mathematical modeling and  evolutionary algorithms. Our students learn how to
 solve engineering problems by 
programming computers in a away that imitates the process of natural selection. 
This is particularly relevant for both practical and theoretical reasons. First,
 evolutionary algorithms are highly cost-efficient when optimising complex systems 
 with a very large number of degrees of freedom. Second, our students learn how to 
 approach reality from the evolutionary perspective. Finally, there are many 
 bioengineering applications for evolutionary algorithms, e.g., 
 parameter optimisation in biological circuits.
