A conference by Sergi Valverde within the frame of the SFI Workshop [Major Transitions in Natural, Synthetic and Artificial Evolution](http://www.santafe.edu/gevent/detail/science/1917/).

When looking at the history of technology, we see that all technologies are not of equal
importance.  Only of a few technologies have the potential to start a new branching series 
(for example, by increasing diversity), have a lasting impact in human life and became 
turning points. These technological transitions correspond to times and places in 
the past when a large number of novel artefact forms or behaviours appeared 
together or in rapid succession.
