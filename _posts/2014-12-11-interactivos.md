title: "Innovation as a Complex System: Technological evolution and Emergence of Computational Creativity"
date: 2014-12-11
---

A conference by Sergi Valverde within the frame of the international symposium [Interactivos?14. Rethinking collective behavior and action](http://medialab-prado.es/article/interactivos14conferenceprogram).

Will machines in the future be able to show an intelligence similar to humans? What will the
social implications of Artificial Inteligence be? In this conference, we want to discuss 
these matters from the point of view of the theory of complex  systems. We will consider that
innovation is a system, instead of a collection of different objects. Technological evolution
offers a unique frame for innovation processes. We can learn a lot about the mechanisms and
principles of innovation by observing the history of great inventions. For example, the history
of technology helps us understand the present scenario, and also to think of the possible
future scenarios of social evolution. The other component of innovation is creativity, and we
are only starting to understand its nature by combinig neuroscience and computer simulations.
