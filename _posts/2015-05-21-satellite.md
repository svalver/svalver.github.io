We (Enrico R. Crema, Xavier Rubio-Campillo and myself) are organising a 
satellite meeting titled "The Cultural Evolution of Technology: Evidence,
Hypothesis and Theory" at the Conference of Complex Systems (CCS) to be held
at Tempe (Arizona). In this satellite meeting we will bring together an
interdisciplinary community of researchers interested in 
understanding the relationship between natural and artificial evolution. 
Our goal is to promote a rich, depth dialogue about this problem from 
different, complementary perspectives. We believe this an important 
step towards a  solid theoretical framework for cultural evolution. 

The deadline for abstract submission is June, 22th.
